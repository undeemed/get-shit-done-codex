# Get Shit Done (GSD) - Agent Instructions

A meta-prompting, context engineering and spec-driven development system for Codex CLI.

## Overview

This system helps you build software projects by:

1. **Deep context gathering** - Understanding what you want to build through structured questioning
2. **Roadmap creation** - Breaking work into phases and plans
3. **Autonomous execution** - Running atomic tasks with fresh context each time
4. **State tracking** - Maintaining project state across sessions

## Core Principles

### Solo Developer Model

- You are planning for ONE person (the user) and ONE implementer (the AI)
- No teams, stakeholders, ceremonies, or coordination overhead
- User is the visionary/product owner
- AI is the builder
- Estimate effort in AI execution time, not human dev time

### Plans Are Prompts

- PLAN.md IS the prompt that executes work
- Contains: Objective, Context, Tasks, Success Criteria
- When planning a phase, you are writing the prompt that will execute it

### Scope Control

**Quality degradation curve:**

- 0-30% context: Peak quality
- 30-50% context: Good quality
- 50-70% context: Degrading quality
- 70%+ context: Poor quality

**Solution:** Aggressive atomicity - 2-3 tasks per plan maximum

### Deviation Rules

During execution:

1. **Auto-fix bugs** - Fix immediately, document
2. **Auto-add critical** - Security/correctness gaps, add immediately
3. **Auto-fix blockers** - Can't proceed, fix immediately
4. **Ask about architectural** - Major changes, stop and ask
5. **Log enhancements** - Nice-to-haves, log to ISSUES.md, continue

### Atomic Git Commits

Each task gets its own commit immediately after completion:

- Format: `{type}({phase}-{plan}): {task-description}`
- Types: feat, fix, test, refactor, perf, chore, docs
- One final metadata commit per plan

## Workflow

### New Projects (Greenfield)

```bash
/gsd:new-project       # Deep questioning → PROJECT.md
/gsd:create-roadmap    # Create ROADMAP.md and STATE.md
/gsd:plan-phase 1      # Create atomic task plans
/gsd:execute-plan      # Subagent executes autonomously
```

### Existing Projects (Brownfield)

```bash
/gsd:map-codebase      # Analyze existing code → codebase/
/gsd:new-project       # Questioning with codebase context
/gsd:create-roadmap    # Continue as normal
```

## File References

When executing commands, reference these files for detailed instructions:

- **Workflows:** `get-shit-done/workflows/*.md`
- **Templates:** `get-shit-done/templates/*.md`
- **References:** `get-shit-done/references/*.md`
- **Commands:** `commands/gsd/*.md`

## Anti-Patterns

NEVER include:

- Team structures, RACI matrices
- Stakeholder management
- Sprint ceremonies
- Human dev time estimates
- Change management processes
- Documentation for documentation's sake

If it sounds like corporate PM theater, delete it.

## Context Engineering

Always load relevant context files:

- `.planning/PROJECT.md` - Project vision
- `.planning/STATE.md` - Current position and decisions
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` - Phase structure
- `.planning/config.json` - Mode settings

For brownfield projects, also load:

- `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `.planning/codebase/CONVENTIONS.md`
- `.planning/codebase/STACK.md`

## Test-Driven Development

Use TDD when beneficial:

- Business logic with defined inputs/outputs
- API endpoints and handlers
- Data transformations and parsing
- Validation rules
- State machines and workflows

Skip TDD for:

- UI layout and styling
- Exploratory prototyping
- One-off scripts and migrations
- Configuration changes

See `get-shit-done/references/tdd.md` for detailed TDD workflow.
